This project is a simple Todo application built with React. It allows users to add todos with a title and description, and displays the list of todos. The count of todos is also displayed.

## Features

- Display the list of todos
- Display the count of todos

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd TodoReact`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

To run the project, use the command: `npm start`

This will start the development server. You can view the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

The main component of the application is `App`. This component manages the state of the todos and the input fields for the title and description. It also contains the logic for adding a new todo.

Here's a brief overview of the `App` component:

- `useState` hooks are used to manage the state of the todos (`todos`), the input fields (`title` and `description`), and the count of todos (`count`).
- The `handleTitleChange` and `handleDescriptionChange` functions update the state of the title and description input fields, respectively, when the user types into them.
- The `addTodo` function adds a new todo to the `todos` state, clears the input fields, and increments the `count`.
- The returned JSX renders the input fields, the "Add todo" button, the count of todos, and the list of todos.
